**November 20 - December 07, 2025: Hackathon & Solution**

During this period, teams will focus intensely on analyzing the problem statement and researching technical documentation on **NGSI-LD Smart Data Models** and **Orion Context Broker** to propose optimal solutions.

### Problem Requirements

Assuming the role of a technology solution provider for **City X**, teams need to find ideas and build IT applications (Web or Mobile) to support the community and management agencies. The product must be operable and usable on the Internet environment.

### Participation Criteria

Teams need to meet the following criteria:

1.  **Data Platform:** The technical solution must be built based on the technical requirements of the open urban data platform (details in the problem statement).
2.  **Packaging & Distribution:** The application must be packaged and distributed via a source code repository (Git), allowing users to easily install and re-setup on a new operating environment.
3.  **Extended Integration:** Encouraging the exploitation and integration of third-party services (such as AI, Digital Maps, AR/VR, etc.) to create advanced utilities for the application.
